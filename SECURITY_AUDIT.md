# Launchpad Security Audit Report

**Date**: July 6, 2026  
**Auditor**: Security Review  
**Scope**: Full application codebase and data handling practices

---

## Executive Summary

This audit identified **4 critical/high-severity vulnerabilities** that require immediate attention, particularly around exposed credentials, personal data handling, and authentication security.

---

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Firebase Configuration Externalized (FIXED)
**Severity**: Critical  
**Location**: `auth.js` lines 6-14  
**CVSS Score**: 7.5 (High)

**Issue**:
- Firebase settings are now read from environment variables instead of being hardcoded
- The repository keeps local `.env` files out of version control

**Risk**: 
- Firebase API keys are still public-facing in browser apps
- Firebase Security Rules must still be configured correctly
- Domain restrictions and App Check are still recommended

**Recommendation**:
1. Keep Firebase configuration in environment variables
2. Implement Firebase Security Rules to restrict database access
3. Use Firebase App Check if possible
4. Restrict API key usage to specific domains in Firebase Console

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

### 2. Personal Data in Unencrypted Exports (HIGH)
**Severity**: High  
**Location**: `db.js` exportAll() function  
**CVSS Score**: 6.5 (Medium)

**Issue**:
- User emails, names, and UIDs included in JSON backups without encryption
- Contact information (phone/email) stored in plaintext for vendors and people
- No data minimization for exports
- Exported files can be freely shared without restrictions

**Risk**:
- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) exposure in backup files
- GDPR/CCPA compliance issues
- Potential data leakage if backup files are mishandled

**Recommendation**:
1. Implement data minimization in exports
2. Add option to exclude personal data from exports
3. Consider encrypting exported files with a user-provided password
4. Add export logging and access controls
5. Implement data retention policies

**Status**: ⚠️ Requires immediate action

---

### 3. Plaintext PIN Storage (MEDIUM)
**Severity**: Medium  
**Location**: `modules/people.js` line 107  
**CVSS Score**: 5.3 (Medium)

**Issue**:
```javascript
<input type="password" class="form-input" id="personPin" value="${escapeHTML(p.pin || '')}" placeholder="4 digits">
```
- PINs stored in plaintext in IndexedDB/Firestore
- No hashing or encryption
- No rate limiting on authentication attempts

**Risk**:
- PINs can be extracted from database dumps
- Brute force attacks possible without rate limiting
- Insider threat if database is compromised

**Recommendation**:
1. Hash PINs using bcrypt or similar before storage
2. Implement rate limiting on PIN authentication
3. Add account lockout after failed attempts
4. Consider removing PIN authentication in favor of OAuth-only
5. Add audit logging for PIN authentication attempts

**Status**: ⚠️ Should be addressed

---

### 4. Insufficient .gitignore Configuration (MEDIUM)
**Severity**: Medium  
**Location**: `.gitignore`  
**CVSS Score**: 4.3 (Medium)

**Issue**:
Original `.gitignore`:
```
firebase-tools
.firebase
```

Missing exclusions for:
- Environment files (.env, .env.local)
- JSON data files (could contain sensitive data)
- Sample data with real user information

**Risk**:
- Accidental commit of sensitive configuration
- Exposure of API keys and secrets
- Data leakage through version control

**Recommendation**:
1. Updated `.gitignore` to include all sensitive file patterns
2. Add pre-commit hooks to prevent sensitive data commits
3. Use git-secrets or similar tools
4. Review existing commits for accidentally committed secrets

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

## Positive Security Findings

### Good Practices Observed:
1. **XSS Protection**: Consistent use of `escapeHTML()` function throughout the codebase
2. **No eval()**: No use of dangerous `eval()` or `Function()` constructors
3. **No document.write()**: Safe DOM manipulation practices
4. **Content Security Policy**: Firebase configuration includes proper domain restrictions
5. **Role-Based Access Control**: Implemented permission system with role hierarchy
6. **Input Sanitization**: Most user inputs are properly escaped before rendering

---

## Additional Security Recommendations

### Authentication & Authorization
1. **Implement Session Management**: Add session timeout and refresh token logic
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Consider adding MFA for mentor accounts
3. **Audit Logging**: Log all authentication attempts and permission changes
4. **Password Policy**: If adding password auth, implement strong password requirements

### Data Protection
1. **Encryption at Rest**: Consider encrypting sensitive data in IndexedDB
2. **Data Retention**: Implement automatic data cleanup for old records
3. **Privacy by Design**: Add privacy controls for users to delete their data
4. **Consent Management**: Implement GDPR consent tracking

### Network Security
1. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure all deployments use HTTPS
2. **CORS Configuration**: Review and restrict CORS policies
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on Firebase operations
4. **Security Headers**: Add CSP, X-Frame-Options, and other security headers

### Code Security
1. **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update Firebase and other dependencies
2. **Code Review**: Implement peer review process for security changes
3. **Security Testing**: Add automated security testing to CI/CD
4. **Bug Bounty**: Consider implementing a bug bounty program

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Right to Access**: Users can export their data ✅
- **Right to Erasure**: No user-initiated data deletion ❌
- **Data Minimization**: Excessive data collection ⚠️
- **Consent**: No explicit consent tracking ❌

### CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- **Right to Know**: Partially implemented ⚠️
- **Right to Delete**: Not implemented ❌
- **Right to Opt-Out**: No data sharing controls ❌

### COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
- **Age Verification**: No age verification ❌
- **Parental Consent**: Not applicable (robotics team context)

## Firebase Security Rules Recommendations

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Users collection - only users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
                        && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Parts, projects, etc. - authenticated users only
    match /parts/{partId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
                   && request.auth.token.role in ['Mentor', 'Lead'];
    }
    
    // Vendors and locations - mentors only
    match /vendors/{vendorId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
                   && request.auth.token.role == 'Mentor';
    }
    
    // Settings - mentors only
    match /settings/{settingId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
                         && request.auth.token.role == 'Mentor';
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Launchpad has a solid foundation with good XSS protection and role-based access control. However, critical issues around credential exposure and personal data handling must be addressed immediately. The application would benefit from implementing the recommended security measures to achieve compliance with modern data protection regulations.

**Overall Security Rating**: 6.5/10  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH

## Next Steps

1. Review this report with the development team
2. Prioritize fixes based on severity
3. Implement Firebase Security Rules immediately
4. Schedule follow-up audit after fixes are deployed
5. Consider engaging a third-party security firm for penetration testing
